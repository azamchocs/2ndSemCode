## Single LinkedList Explanation

Implementing a linked list using Pomodoro timer as the example

1. Making the first class(object) as the head of the linkedlist.
2. Everytime a new set of data is added to the list, the object will then be connected with the previous one with an input
3. When a set of data is removed from the list, the output of the previous one will be printed as not connected to the previous set of data. It's like turning a page but there's no more page to look at.

Program usage are as follows :
1. To monitor your usage within the linkedlist.
2. To review all of the contents of the linkedlist.
3. To add a new set of data to the linkedlist.
4. To remove a set of data to the linkedlist but it is optional.

Outputs are shown below :
